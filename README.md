## Motivation

The primary consumer of these functions will be [Pulumi YAML](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-yaml).
Secondary consumers will be code that is generated by `pulumi convert` from
[Pulumi YAML](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-yaml). This allows generated code to have the exact
same regular expression semantics as [Pulumi YAML](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-yaml).
